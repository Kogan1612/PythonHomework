# PythonHomework

This repository contains questions 1-7 from the Python homework.

A few remarks about the answers to the questions:
* In question number 2 I used a more general answer instead of just a few ifs that work only with a 3X3 board.
* In question number 7 I added a delay to the transactions so when making transactions simultaneously it could take a few seconds for messages to appear in the console.
* In question 7 I used a queue to handle all the tasks from the ATMs so two transactions can't occur simultaneously, that way the records stay safe.
